# Research: ad blocking and video downloads in the YouTube iOS app

*November 2026. Background for `AdBlock.x`, `SponsorBlock.x` and `Downloader/`.*

## TL;DR

- **Ad blocking only works reliably inside the app process.** YouTube serves ads through the same InnerTube API responses and the same `googlevideo.com` media servers as the videos themselves, so DNS or host blocklists (Pi-hole, NextDNS, AdGuard DNS) can't tell ads from content. A tweak runs inside YouTube, so it can remove the ads from the decoded response objects before the app acts on them. That is what `AdBlock.x` does, in four layers: video ads, feed ads, Shorts ads and shopping placements.
- **Sponsorships the creator reads out are part of the video itself.** No response rewriting can remove them. `SponsorBlock.x` skips them using community-submitted timings from SponsorBlock. It's a fifth layer, and its lookups only send a 4-character hash prefix of the video ID.
- **The biggest long-term threat is server-side ad insertion (SSAI).** There the ad is stitched into the media stream itself. The iOS player already has a code path for it (`MLPlayerReloadContext … disableDAI:`). If YouTube turns it on for the app, removing the ad schedule from the response will no longer be enough. Sources disagree about how far it has rolled out (see below).
- **Downloads:** since the switch to SABR (server-side adaptive bitrate), the YouTube app's own player response no longer contains per-format stream URLs. The downloader asks InnerTube for the same video with client profiles that still get plain URLs without a proof-of-origin (PO) token (`VISIONOS`, then `ANDROID_VR`). It downloads them in 8 MiB range chunks and merges video and audio with AVFoundation. No FFmpeg is involved.

## Part 1 — Ad blocking

### Where the ads come from

All YouTube content reaches the app as protobuf messages from InnerTube (`youtubei.googleapis.com/youtubei/v1/...`). The app decodes them into generated `YTI…` Objective-C classes (subclasses of `GPBMessage`). Ads arrive in the same messages:

| Ad type | Where it lives in the response | Class / field (iOS app) |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-, mid- and post-roll video ads | `/player` response | `YTIPlayerResponse.playerAdsArray`, `adSlotsArray`, `adPlacementsArray`, `isMonetized` |
| Ads in Home / Search / Watch next | `/browse`, `/search`, `/next` responses | `YTIElementRenderer`s carrying `compatibilityOptions.adLoggingData` or ad layout identifiers (`feed_ad_metadata`, `text_search_ad`, `product_carousel`, …), plus `promotedVideoRenderer` items |
| Inline feed ads inserted later | Ad slots attached to the list | `YTAdElementsCellExternallyManagedSlotAdapterImpl` |
| Shorts ads | `/reel/...` sequence entries | `YTReelModel.videoType == 3`, `YTReelNonVideoContentModel` with `reelNonVideoAdsCustomData` |
| Shopping / product placements | `/next` `onUiReady` commands, player overlays | Engagement panel `PAproduct_list`, overlay `player_overlay_product_in_video`, view `eml.expandable_metadata.vpp` |
| The ad media itself | `googlevideo.com` | Same servers and URL format as regular videos |

### Approaches I evaluated

| # | Approach | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **DNS / host blocking** (Pi-hole, NextDNS, AdGuard DNS, a hosts file) | ❌ Doesn't work for YouTube. Ads and videos come from the same `googlevideo.com` hosts and the same InnerTube API, so blocking them breaks playback. This is the consensus on the Pi-hole and NextDNS forums. Only third-party trackers (`doubleclick.net`, `googlesyndication.com`) can be blocked, and that doesn't remove a single ad. |
| 2 | **Request blocking inside the app** (an `NSURLProtocol` or session hook that drops "ad" requests) | ❌ Same problem: there are no separate ad requests to drop. YouTube also does most of its networking through Cronet (Chromium's network stack), which bypasses `NSURLProtocol`, so coverage would be partial and fragile. Not implemented. |
| 3 | **Don't ask for ads** (strip the ad context and ad-targeting signals from outgoing requests) | ⚠️ Helps a little (less targeting) but doesn't remove ads on its own. Kept as a supporting layer (`YTAdsInnerTubeContextDecorator`, `YTDataUtils` / `YTAdShieldUtils` signal hooks). |
| 4 | **Rewrite the response model** (remove ads from the decoded protobuf objects before the player, feed or Shorts code reads them) | ✅ **The approach used.** It works because the tweak runs inside the app and sees the messages after TLS and decoding. It is what PoomSmart's YouTube-X (MIT, maintained against current YouTube builds), ytkace and YouMod all do. |
| 5 | **Hide views after they render** | ⚠️ A last resort only. It leaves blank gaps and depends on view identifiers that change often. Used for two leftovers (`elementData` and the `.vpp` view). |
| 6 | **Skip by timing** (seek past known segments) | ✅ **Implemented for in-video sponsorships via SponsorBlock** (layer 5 below). Timing-based skipping would also be the only client-side answer to stitched-in (SSAI) ads, but that part isn't built yet (see "Next steps"). |

### What `AdBlock.x` does

Everything is behind the existing **Remove ads** switch (`noAds`, on by default). Every hook checks the switch when it runs and calls the original behavior when the switch is off.

| Layer | Hook | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Video ads | `YTIPlayerResponse` `playerAdsArray` / `adSlotsArray` / `adPlacementsArray` → empty | The player never learns about ad breaks. These are protobuf getters that `GPBMessage` creates lazily, so they are swapped at runtime in `%ctor` (see `YTLOverrideGetter`). `class_getInstanceMethod` triggers the lazy resolution first. |
| | `YTIPlayerResponse.isMonetized` → NO | Older code paths. |
| | `YTLocalPlaybackController createAdsPlaybackCoordinator` → nil | No ad playback coordinator, so nothing can schedule an ad. |
| | `MDXSession(Impl) adPlaying:`, `YTIClientMdxGlobalConfig enableSkippableAd` | Casting (TV) sessions. |
| | Ad context decorators, spam/ad signals, `YTHotConfig …FillingEncodedHacks…` | Stop sending ad-targeting context. |
| 2. Feed ads | `YTInnerTubeCollectionViewController` (`displaySections…`, `addSectionsFromArray:`), `YTArraySectionViewModel` (all entry paths) | Removes sections, shelf items and entries whose element renderer has ad logging data or an ad layout identifier. |
| | `YTAdElementsCellExternallyManagedSlotAdapterImpl isValidSlotType:` → NO | Inline feed ads inserted later through ad slots. |
| | `YTSectionListViewController loadWithModel:` | Promoted videos (older YouTube versions). |
| | `YTIElementRenderer elementData` (in `YTLite.x`) | A last line of defense: blanks elements that carry ad logging data themselves. The old identifier list here compared each identifier with `containsObject:` against the whole description, so it never matched. It was removed rather than "fixed": a renderer's description includes its nested children, so matching it would also blank containers that merely hold an ad. |
| 3. Shorts ads | `YTReelDataSource` / `YTReelInfinitePlaybackDataSource` / `YTReelContentModel` `makeContentModelForEntry:`, `setReels:` | Ad entries are dropped from the Shorts sequence. |
| 4. Shopping | `YTWatchNextResponseViewController loadWithModel:` | Removes the auto-opening "products in this video" panel (`PAproduct_list`). |
| | `YTMainAppVideoPlayerOverlayViewController playerOverlayProvider:didInsertPlayerOverlay:` | Drops the `player_overlay_product_in_video` overlay. |
| | `_ASDisplayView didMoveToWindow` | Removes the `eml.expandable_metadata.vpp` product row. |

YouTube Premium upsells and interstitial promos were already blocked by the NoYTPremium hooks in `YTLite.x`. The separate "Hide paid promotion card" option still controls the "Includes paid promotion" label.

The ad-layout list follows YouTube-X (October 2026) with two deliberate, conservative exceptions:
- `post_shelf` is **not** treated as an ad, so community posts in the feed stay visible.
- Of the `eml.expandable_metadata…` rows under a video, only the product-placement variant `eml.expandable_metadata.vpp` is removed. The bare prefix would also remove other expandable rows (for example music or chapter info).

Optional protobuf fields such as `hasPromotedVideoRenderer` are read through `respondsToSelector:`. YouTube drops fields between versions, and calling a getter that no longer exists would crash the feed.

### Server-side ad insertion (SSAI / "DAI")

With SSAI the ad is part of the video segments the server sends, so there is no separate ad to remove. Facts and claims:

- The iOS player already knows about it: `MLPlayerReloadContext` has an initializer with `disableSABR:` and `disableDAI:` (Dynamic Ad Insertion) flags (from the YouTubeHeader dumps). No open-source tweak hooks this yet. It's the obvious place to investigate if stitched ads appear in the app.
- Reports conflict on how widely it has rolled out. A blocker vendor claims a global rollout in 2026. Privacy Intact said it was still limited testing as of July 10, 2026. Geeky Gadgets describes it as an experiment.
- What would likely still work against stitched ads is timing-based skipping. This is an inference, not verified: the player presumably still needs the ad-break boundaries to show the ad UI (the "Ad" label and skip button), so they would probably still be in the response and could be seeked past. SponsorBlock-style community timings are another option. YouTube Premium is the only approach that is fully reliable.

### Layer 5: in-video sponsorships with SponsorBlock (`SponsorBlock.x`)

"This video is sponsored by…" segments are part of the video itself, so they can only be skipped by time. [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) is a community database of such segments. The API usage below was checked against the server's own route code (October 2026), since the API isn't reachable from the sandbox.

- **Lookup (privacy-preserving):** `GET /api/skipSegments/<first 4 hex chars of SHA-256(videoID)>?categories=[…]&actionTypes=["skip","poi"]`. The server answers with every video in that hash bucket, or `404` when none has segments, and the app keeps the entry whose `videoID` matches. The video ID itself is never sent. Answers are cached for the session. Failures (timeouts, rate limits, a captive portal) are never cached and are retried after 10 s.
- **Credit (opt-in):** `POST /api/viewedVideoSponsorTime?UUID=…` counts a skip for the segment's submitters, as the official extension does. A segment ID identifies its video, so this only happens when *Count skips for submitters* is on. It's off by default.
- **Where it hooks:** the same `YTPlayerViewController` points current SponsorBlock tweaks use. `playbackController:didActivateVideo:withPlaybackData:` starts the lookup. `singleVideo:` and `potentiallyMutatedSingleVideo:currentVideoTimeDidChange:` evaluate the current time, and `seekToTime:` skips. It does nothing in Shorts, muted feed previews or while an ad plays.
- **Decisions:** made by a small pure-C function (`SponsorBlock/YTLSponsorBlockLogic.c`) so they can be unit-tested. An auto-skip beats a skip button. With overlapping segments, the one reaching furthest wins. It ignores segments shorter than 0.5 s or whose end is under 0.5 s away, segments for a cut of the video whose length differs by more than 10 s, and highlights except during the first seconds of playback. Rewinding before a segment arms it again. Replaying, looping or seeking back to the start begins a fresh viewing, but the app's own "Unskip" seek doesn't count. Time updates are matched against the video they belong to, so segments never apply to the next video while the player switches.
- **Per category:** Off, Ask (a button in the player's bottom-right corner) or Auto-skip (with a five-second **Unskip** notice). The defaults follow the official extension: sponsors are auto-skipped; self-promotion, interaction reminders and highlights get a button; intros, endcards, previews, filler and non-music sections are off.

### Next steps (not implemented)

1. **SSAI fallback**: if stitched ads show up, read the ad-break timing before it is stripped and seek past it, or experiment with the `disableDAI` reload flag.
2. **SponsorBlock extras**: colored segments on the progress bar, a per-channel whitelist, and submitting or voting on segments. The 5.x strings for these are already in the bundle.

## Part 2 — Downloading videos to local storage

### Why the app's own stream URLs can't be used anymore

YouTube moved its own apps to **SABR** (server-side adaptive bitrate). Media is requested through a single `serverAbrStreamingUrl` using the UMP protocol, and the server chooses the segments. The player response still lists every format (itag, codec, size), but the per-format `url` is empty. YouMod's source states this for YouTube 21.29, and I saw the same thing on 2026-11-01: an InnerTube `/player` request with the `IOS` client (the app's own client) returned 16 adaptive formats and **0** URLs.

### Options

| Option | Notes | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| URLs from the app's own response | Only works on YouTube versions from before SABR. | Kept as a **fallback** |
| **Another InnerTube client profile that still gets plain URLs** | One extra `/player` request per download. No signature deciphering or PO token needed for these clients. | ✅ **Primary** |
| Replay the app's own SABR/UMP requests | YouMod and ytkace do this. It captures the app's signed `videoplayback` request and parses UMP parts. Very version-sensitive (protobuf field numbers change). | Too fragile to maintain here |
| HLS manifest + `AVAssetDownloadURLSession` | Only some clients get `hlsManifestUrl`, and the result is a `.movpkg`. | Not used |
| Web/TV clients | Need a JavaScript player for signature and `n` deciphering plus a PO token (yt-dlp now needs an external JS runtime for this). | Not feasible in a tweak |

**Client survey (2026-11-01).** Same public video, logged out, with `visitorData`:

| Client | Status | Direct URLs |
|---|---|---|
| `VISIONOS` 1.02 | OK | all adaptive formats (+ HLS) |
| `ANDROID_VR` 1.65.10 | OK | all adaptive formats + muxed 360p (itag 18) |
| `IOS` / `ANDROID` | OK | **none** (SABR only) |
| `TVHTML5`, `MWEB` | UNPLAYABLE ("The page needs to be reloaded.") | — |

Without `visitorData` even `VISIONOS` returns `LOGIN_REQUIRED`. Every InnerTube client sends visitor data, and the downloader fetches it once and reuses it until it expires. It does **not** rotate identities or retry after a bot check. A bot-check answer is shown to the user as YouTube's own message.

This matches yt-dlp's documentation as of mid-2026. Its default clients are `tv_samsung, visionos, web`. `android_vr` needs no PO token, but "made for kids" videos aren't available through it. `ios` and `android` need a PO token. `web` only has SABR formats.

### Pipeline (`Downloader/`)

1. **`YTLStreamResolver`**: tries `VISIONOS`, then `ANDROID_VR`, then the app's own response. It returns only formats that have a URL, with the matching User-Agent.
2. **Quality picker**: H.264 MP4 up to 1080p60 (plays everywhere and can be saved to Photos). AV1 MP4 up to 4K is offered **only** on devices with a hardware AV1 decoder (A17 Pro / M3 or later on iOS 17+). VP9 and Opus are in WebM containers that AVFoundation can't remux without FFmpeg, so they're skipped. Audio-only uses AAC and lists one entry per audio track for dubbed videos. "Stable volume" (DRC) duplicates are dropped.
3. **`YTLChunkedDownloader`**: 8 MiB HTTP `Range` requests, 3 in parallel. `googlevideo.com` throttles long single requests, and yt-dlp uses ≤10 MiB chunks for the same reason. Failed chunks are retried, and a `403`/`410` (expired URL) triggers a fresh `/player` lookup for the same itag.
4. **`YTLMediaMuxer`**: AVFoundation passthrough (`AVMutableComposition` + `AVAssetExportPresetPassthrough`). The video and audio streams become one `.mp4` without re-encoding. When the export session doesn't list MP4 among its supported file types for the codec, it falls back to `.mov`. The list is checked first because assigning an unsupported type raises an exception. Audio is remuxed to a regular `.m4a`. Cancelling also cancels a running export.
5. **Saving**: the file goes to `Documents/Downloads`, which is excluded from iCloud backup. Names are capped at 200 UTF-8 bytes, since APFS allows 255 bytes per name and a CJK character takes 3. If the move still fails, the video ID is used as the name, so a finished download is never lost. Work folders left behind by a killed app are removed at the next launch. After that, an "After download" setting decides what happens: ask, Photos, Files (export to any folder), share sheet, or keep in the app.

**Seeing files in the Files app:** an app's Documents folder only appears under *On My iPhone › YouTube* when its Info.plist has `UIFileSharingEnabled` and `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace`. The *Create YouTube Plus app* workflow adds both keys. That build gives YouTube Plus for free, so anyone can use it. On jailbroken installs, use "Save to Files" or "Share" instead.

### Limitations

- Private, members-only, age-restricted and "made for kids" videos may fail. YouTube's own error message is shown. The downloader deliberately makes logged-out requests and never sends your account cookies or token.
- Live streams and premieres can't be downloaded.
- Keep YouTube open while downloading. The app gets a short background grace period, not unlimited background time.
- Client profiles age. If YouTube stops serving URLs to `VISIONOS` and `ANDROID_VR`, update `YTLClientProfiles()` in `Downloader/YTLStreamResolver.m`. yt-dlp's `player_client` defaults are a good indicator of what currently works.
- Use it for personal offline viewing and respect creators' rights. YouTube Premium offers official offline downloads.

## How this was verified

- All new and changed sources were type-checked with clang (`-Wall -Werror`, iOS 13 deployment target, iPhoneOS 16.5 SDK, the same flags Theos uses) against **two** YouTubeHeader revisions: `07bb69b` (July 2024, matching these sources) and `4b9977e` (October 2026). Logos files were checked through a converter that reproduces Logos's generated C functions. The four existing upstream `.x` files pass as well, after fixing one `-Wmisleading-indentation` error in `Sideloading.x` that would fail a `-Werror` build on current compilers.
- The InnerTube format discovery above was observed directly on 2026-11-01.
- SponsorBlock's decision function passes 32 unit-test checks run natively: priorities, end guard, short and outdated segments, segments past the end of the video, highlight windows, NaN times. The API calls were checked against the SponsorBlock server's route handlers.
- **Not verified here:** running on a device. The sandbox can't reach `googlevideo.com` or `sponsor.ajay.app`, so the actual media download, the merge, live SponsorBlock lookups and every hook's runtime behavior still need testing in the app. Use the **Build from source** workflow option to produce an IPA.
