# YTLite Pro
A flexible enhancer for YouTube on iOS, featuring over hundred customizable options.

YTLite Pro is a standalone copy of [dayanch96/YTLite](https://github.com/dayanch96/YTLite) (YouTube Plus, ex. YTLite). It adds a downloader, a layered ad blocker and SponsorBlock to the open-source tweak; see [below](#downloader-ad-blocker--sponsorblock-built-from-this-repository). It isn't a fork, so upstream changes are merged in by hand and can't overwrite these additions.

## Downloader, ad blocker & SponsorBlock (built from this repository)
This repository's source adds these features to the open-source YTLite tweak:
- **Download videos and audio to local storage.** The player and Shorts get a download button that opens a quality picker: H.264 up to 1080p, AV1 up to 4K on devices with a hardware AV1 decoder, or audio only. Files are saved to the app's `Documents/Downloads` folder. From there you can save them to Photos, export them to the Files app or share them. To manage them, go to *YouTube settings › YTLite › Downloading*.
- **Layered ad blocker.** It removes video ads, ads in the feed, search and Shorts, and shopping placements. It's controlled by *General › Remove ads*, which is on by default.
- **SponsorBlock.** It skips sponsor segments that creators read out, using community timings from [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app). Each category can be set to Off, Ask (shows a skip button) or Auto-skip (with an Unskip button), and an optional sound or haptic plays on skips. It's on by default. Lookups send only a 4-character hash prefix of the video ID. Counting your skips for the segment submitters is a separate opt-in switch, because it reveals the video. Find it under *YouTube settings › YTLite › SponsorBlock*.

How it works, the options considered and the known limits: [docs/Research.md](docs/Research.md).

To get these features into an app, run **Create YouTube Plus app** with **Build the tweak from this repository's source** ticked. The workflow then compiles this repository instead of downloading the YouTube Plus release. It also makes the downloads folder visible in the Files app under *On My iPhone › YouTube*.
